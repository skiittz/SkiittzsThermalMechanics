Reactors, Batteries, H2 Engines, and H2 Thrusters will produce heat proportional to their output. Once enough heat has built up they will begin to take damage.

Damage can be delayed by building a heat sink on the grid. All excess heat will be stored in the heat sink until it is full (be careful! if a hot heat sink is destroyed, all that stored heat has to go somewhere!)

To cool your heat sink, build one or more radiators. These will ramp up over time, and at full efficiency can dissipate up 50MW of heat (5MW for small grid) per 100 ticks, each. But this dissipated heat will manifest as a signal that can be seen by other players. The more heat dissipated, the further the signal can be detected.

Radiators must be exposed to open space on the face that you would expect heat to dissipate from, if they detect another block on front of them, they will not work.

Protect your heat sinks.  if they are destroyed or are otherwise ejected, all that stored heat will be fed back into your generators.  This can be catastrophic.  Heat sinks can be fully enclosed.
